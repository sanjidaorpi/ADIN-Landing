# ADIN Landing Page

Build Notes:

Decisions I'm proud of: I spent a lot of time considering how the animation on the multicolor tag should look. I went back and forth between different animations types all using a sliding carousel approach. Although the spacing between each word doesn't match exactly to the design, upon many different iterations I decided that to achieve the centering effect on one word at a time it looked best to add this space instead of having the words jitter left and right or not be exactly centered. Between the many different iteration of animations I tried out, i think this is the most satisfying! But I'm very curious as to how other feel about it and would love to get user feddback to adjust the feel/softness of that effect. I am also proud of the other animations which apply a gradient sweep effect on some text which I think came out quite nice after a bunch of tweaking on speed and size. On desktop view I achieved a close clone of the design I would say, which I'm proud of.

Tradeoffs: Like I mentioned above, the spacing between the words on the colored tags was a tradeoff I made to land a more seamless/soft look as it was jittery or uncentered in approaches that matched the Figma design spacing exactly. Additionally, the navigation bar which I created a separate layout for for on mobile layout, there could be another way of getting a small naigation bar instead of switching to a drop down potentially.

Fast Follows: Making the responsiveness to different screen sizes smoother if possible and changing the mobile layout a bit, specifically the navigation layout and maybe changing the hamburger option based on feedback and what others think of it. I'm currently working on making the space above the live reports smaller on mobile view but I could see that maybe not being shown on mobile view at all or requiring a button click to pop up / lead to another page. I would love to make adjustments on the responsiveness based on feedback from design.

Overall, I'd love any/all feedback on these choices and I appreciate it in advance!!!
