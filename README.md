# ADIN Landing Page

Build Notes:

Decisions I'm proud of: I spent a lot of time considering how the animation on the multicolor tage should look. I went back and forth between different animations types all using a sliding carousel approach. Although the spacing between each word doesn't match exactly to the design, upon many different iterations I decided that to achieve the centering effect on one word at a time it was best to add this space instead of having the words jitter left and right or not be exactly centered. Between the many different iteration of animations I tried out, i think this is the most satisfying! But I'm very curious as to how other feel about it and would love to get user feddback to adjust the feel/softness of that effect. I am also proud of the other animations which apply a gradient sweep effect on some text which I think came out quite nice after a bunch of tweaking on speed and size.

Tradeoffs: Like I mentioned above, the spacing between the words on the colored tags was a tradeoff I made to land a more seamless/soft look as it was jittery or uncertered in my approaches where it matched the Figma design exactly. Additionally, the navigation bar which I created a separate layout for for mobile layout.

Fast Follows: Making the responsiveness to different screen sizes smoother if possible and changing the mobile layout a bit, specifically the navigation layout and maybe changing the hamburger option based on feedback and what others think of it.

Overall, I'd love any/all feedback on these choices and I appreciate it in advance!!!
